# Titanic_Kaggle_challenge

Simple set of scripts with a simple approach to the famous Kaggle Titanic Challenge. The challenge consists of predicting whether different passengers survive based on characteristics such as "Sex", "Ticket fare", "Age" and others. See the website for more details: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic.

These scripts serve as a basic starting point to explore more elaborate data cleaning and modeling approaches.
